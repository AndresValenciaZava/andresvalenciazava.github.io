    <p><h2>Andres Valencia Zava</h2> I'm abstract painter originally from Colombia living in Toronto, ON. As an artist I'm fascinated with the beauty of color and layers of emotion.
    My art is my voice, thoughts and strong desires. My goal and part of my process is to recreate the color and brushstrokes I want to evoke in my paintings.
    Although I work primarily in abstract I love also to capture the light and matter that remains in the nature.
    My work includes dynamic, strong bold strokes, marks, texture and spontaneity.
    Even though I have had art training I'm also a self- taught artist.
    By being an artist, I can finally get in touch with my feelings.</p>
